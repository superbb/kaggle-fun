This notebook is for Kaggle's [Housing Prices Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) ongoing competition.

It's based off the practice [lab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/feature-engineering-for-house-prices) in Kaggle's [Feature Engineering course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering).
I focused on building thorough data exploration and imputation strategies that I could reuse later--hence the detailed work even when only one entry was missing.
I built the notebook in Colab to take advantage of some of the platform's display and navigation features and then updated it to make it compatible with other notebooks.

I used Grok and Jules for code reviews.
